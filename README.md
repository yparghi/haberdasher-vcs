# Haberdasher

Haberdasher is a version control system for large repos, designed for deep customizability: custom datastore, custom hooks and workflows, custom network protocols, etc.


## State of the project

_Pre-alpha._

The server and client run, but only with very basic operations that have undergone only basic testing. At this point, you can (and should) only use it with a local test HBase server.

Also, the data model is still in progress so the database schema and row key format etc. could still change at any time.

## Why are you hosting the code on GitHub?

Hosting on GitHub is temporary while we set up the Haberdasher website.
